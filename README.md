Dog Casino
==========

This is a slot machine that dispenses dog treats whenever a dog runs through multiple points, triggering ultrasonic sensors. Don't judge me.

To-dos
---
* Hook up servo to some sort of tray to create the dispensers
* Hook up second ultrasonic sensor and write code to require dog to run through both
* Find a good encasement for it all
* Hook up a high-energy capaciter since the servo seems to cause the board to firmware to restart when first connected
* Buy a second servo in case of emergency -- I think I saw smoke coming out of the first one at some point
* Label the wires
* Draw a schematic and add it to the repo for the public
* Learn how to draw a schematic. I studied Computer Science, not Electrical Engineering. Give me a break.
